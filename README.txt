Rancher Icons
=============

Icons used by the Rancher Dashboard UI.

To build the icon font:

- npm install
- npm run build

The font files are generated in the 'dist' folder.

You can open the file 'demo.html' in the dist folder to view the available icons.

Once built, you can copy the build font to a local copy of the Rancher Dashboard UI with:

npm run copy <DASHBOARD_FOLDER>
